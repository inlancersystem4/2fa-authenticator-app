Sign-in:

  Check if the user exists.
  If the user does not exist, return an error.
  If the user exists, proceed to step 2.


Validate Credentials:

  Check if the email and password match.
  If either is incorrect, return an error.
  If both are correct, return a success response.


Success Response:

  On successful sign-in, send the user_id (for socket channel).
  Confirm whether the userâ€™s account is set up or not.


Account Setup (if not completed):

  Share a QR code with the user.
  The user scans the QR code via the mobile app.
  The mobile app sends a 2-digit code, which is verified.
  Upon successful verification, redirect to the web app dashboard with a session.


Account Setup with 2-Digit Code:

  The user receives a 2-digit code notification (every time a new code is generated).
  Optionally, include a recovery code in the notification.


Instead Code Verification:

  If the "instead code" is used:
  Verify the code on the mobile app.
  After successful verification, update the mobile app code and redirect the user to the web app dashboard with a session.


Recovery Code Verification:

  If the "recovery code" is used:
  Verify the recovery code.
  Upon successful verification, redirect to the web app dashboard with a session.
  Remove the submitted recovery code once verified.
